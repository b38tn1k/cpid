        <p>A PID controller is to be designed to operate on a host server and provide control data to a client via the Internet. As the controller will have to operate in real time, packet loss and network latency will have to be accounted for. A client account will allow developers to choose gain values for the PID controller. The server and the client will have different data communication responsibilities during operation.</p>

<p>Error is calculated on the client side of the Internet to minimise latency and allow the client to dynamically change set point. A server based PID controller will be complemented with a simple linear predictor that utilises the current latency value in an attempt to time the arrival of a control effort data packet at the client in such a way that minimises error. Both the Control Effort and Error data will be sent accompanied by a time code and sequence number to allow for packet confirmation.</p>
